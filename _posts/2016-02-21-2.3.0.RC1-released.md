(see [#134](https://github.com/togglz/togglz/issue/134){:target="_blank"} and [#154](https://github.com/togglz/togglz/pull/154){:target="_blank"})
*   New Hazelcast module. Many thanks to [Camiel de Vleeschauwer](https://github.com/camielza){:target="_blank"} for his contribution. (see [#153](https://github.com/togglz/togglz/pull/153){:target="_blank"})
*   Many minor improvements for the Spring `BeanFinder` implementations which now should work much better especially in non Spring Web environments.
*   New annotation `@DefaultActivationStrategy` which can be used to specify a default strategy for a feature directly on the enum. (see [#141](https://github.com/togglz/togglz/pull/141){:target="_blank"})
