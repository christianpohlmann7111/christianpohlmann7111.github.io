*   The `Feature` interface doesn't force the user to implement `isActive()` anymore. Please note that this change requires you to remove the `@Override` annotation from your implementation of the method.
*   Fixed a bug that caused `JDBCStateRepository` too work in the wrong database schema (see [#38](https://github.com/togglz/togglz/issues/38){:target="_blank"}).
*   The new Togglz JSP integration module provides a JSP taglib that simplifies checking feature states in JSP pages. Thanks to [Mauro Talevi](https://github.com/maurotalevi){:target="_blank"} for his help on this.
*   Added `SingleUserProvider` to simplify configuration of environments where only one (virtual) user exists.
*   Feature definitions can now be configured using property files instead of a Java enum. This can be especially useful in distributed environments where components doesn't share any code. Thanks to [Mauro Talevi](https://github.com/maurotalevi){:target="_blank"} for implementing this feature.
*   Added new `NamedFeature` to replace the deprecated `UntypedFeature`
*   The Togglz Admin Console is now distributable and therefore works in clustered environments (see [#32](https://github.com/togglz/togglz/issues/32){:target="_blank"}).
