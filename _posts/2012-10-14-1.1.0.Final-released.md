*   The new [CachingStateRepository](/apidocs/1.1.0.Final/org/togglz/core/repository/cache/CachingStateRepository.html) allows to add caching capabilities to existing state repositories. See the chapter on [State Repositories](/documentation/repositories.html#CachingStateRepository) for details.
*   The Spring integration module now contains the [FeatureProxyFactoryBean](/apidocs/1.1.0.Final/org/togglz/spring/proxy/FeatureProxyFactoryBean.html), which allows to use different Spring beans depending on a specific feature state. The [Usage](/documentation/usage.html#FeatureProxyFactoryBean) chapter contains concrete examples on how to configure this factory bean.
*   It's now possible to define groups of features. These groups will be displayed in different tabs in the Togglz Admin Console. See the [Feature Groups](/documentation/feature-groups.html) chapter to learn how to setup these groups.
*   Togglz now contains special support for handling feature toggles in unit tests. As part of this two new integration modules have been added. The first one provides general support for unit testing and the second one offers advanced support for JUnit. See the new [Testing Support](/documentation/testing.html) chapter for details.
