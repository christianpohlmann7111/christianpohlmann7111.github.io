We are very proud to announce the release of Togglz 2.6.0.Final. The most noteworthy feature of this version is support for Spring Boot 2.0. Many thanks to [Rui Figueira](https://github.com/ruifigueira){:target="_blank"} for helping with this. Spring Boot users should definitely have a look at the [updating notes](updating_notes.html) page. 
Enjoy!
